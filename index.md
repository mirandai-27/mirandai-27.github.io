### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Part 2 of lab 6 was definitely a big favorite of mine. I enjoy playing
    card games with friends, so creating a blackjack game was fun for me.
    Also, the part where we needed to figure out how to count an Ace was
    very interesting to me. I don't think I did it correctly, but I used an
    if-statement that subtracted 10 from the total score if both cards were
    aces. This lab showed me that there are multiple answers to every
    problem, and it is up to me to figure out which answer is the best.

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was another big favorite of mine, not only because it was short,
    but also because I learned a lot about boolean operators. A lot of the
    projects we did in class used if-statements, and this lab was no
    exception. This lab allowed me to improve my understanding of how the
    compiler reads and computes my code. Combining the use of the "&&" and
    "||" operators in a single statement was intimidating at first, but
    became easy to understand after this lab. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 was a satisfying end to the class, and was my third favorite of
    our labs. It was fun to work on a project that created a .gif file,
    which is something I didn't think I'd be able to do at the start of the
    semester. The biggest takeaway I had from this lab was the use of
    classes like Magick. Before this lab, I didn't feel completely
    confident with the topic, but this project allowed me to get a little
    more comfortable with object oriented programming, and also showed me
    how powerful it can be, as a lot of the functions used in the code were
    predefined in the Magick h file.
